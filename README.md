 This is a driving simulation game that can educate the user and by using the rules and regulation based on the Philippine traffic rules and regulation. Users will be educated by a quiz mode on the game which is also a reviewer if ever that they want to get a license. They may also test their skills using the actual driving simulation that incorporates real life scenarios in Philippine roads.
